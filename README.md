# gpa-calc
Simple GPA calculator to practice using Angular

<b>TODO</b>
<ul>
  <li>gpa.html line 29-ish: Get pattern matching to work so that credits must be X.X or just X, where X is a digit.
  <li>gpa.js updateGPA: not working. I think the problem is that either credits or weight is a string rather than a number. Means we will need to parseInt and do some input checking and stuff. The input checking can hopefully be avoided if we complete the above TODO item (can get the credits to match the regexp correctly).
</ul>
